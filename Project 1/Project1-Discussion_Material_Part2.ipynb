After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were\\nintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining\\n5.41 wouldn\\'t even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and\\nexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.\\n\\nWell, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.\\nOften, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I\\nthen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive\\nby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the\\nIIsi and boot from the HD. I\\'ve called La Cie again and they\\'ve given me\\nanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn\\'t see\\nthe drive there\\'s a definite hardware problem.\\n\\nGiven that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send\\nme a *new* one, but they said \"no.\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased\\nmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.\\n\\nI can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors\\nmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And\\nI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden\\nprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these\\nfacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that\\nwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one\\nthey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I\\'ll have to again\\nreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data\\nrecovery.)\\n\\nIt seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a\\ndiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still\\ncovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. \\n\\nI feel a little helpless about all this. I don\\'t mean to necessarily flame La\\nCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.\\nBut c\\'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent\\na letter to La Cie\\'s customer service when the first drive was returned and I\\nasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive\\nthree weeks before they slashed the price.

Works\\nquite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so\\nleaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear\\nand feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or\\ndown in features.\\n\\nFor price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here\\ncompared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra\\n$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson\\nto let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.\\n\\nJust another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something\\nthat needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle\\nWolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,\\ndown, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into\\na Gravis gamepad.

It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow\\nand proclaimed \"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks\\nof me. Beauty.\"\\n\\nNext, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to\\nhim, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all\\nthe arenas in the NHL.\\n\\nFrom there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game\\nhad great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game\\nin the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All\\nstop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary\\nby Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most\\npenalties gets to ref in the finals.\\n\\nNext, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for\\nthe Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the\\nwins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup\\nand the AHL championships.\\n\\nFinally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the\\nRangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved.\\nDon feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had\\nseveral key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who\\nwent cold.\\n\\nDon had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party\\'s over,\\nAdolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer\\nbe a \\'country club\\'.... \"NY should be achamed of themselves...

But that is\\nonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with\\ninjuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really\\nrather be playing golf, don\\'t really give a damn.  Of course I can\\'t say this\\nfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I\\ndon\\'t think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically\\nhuman attitudes.  \\n\\nWith the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing \\nmoney by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\\n\"take\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are\\ngoing to come back with \"winning spirit\" and all of that crap but these\\nplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the \\ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\\na decent living. \\n\\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \\nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\\n\\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \\nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \"hot\".  The \\nemphasis on the playoffs, with their \"sudden death\" appeal has been promoted\\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh\\nloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the\\nleague over the year.  They proved it.\\n\\ncordially, as always,\\n\\nrm\\n\\n-- \\nRoger Maynard \\nmaynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca \\n',\n",

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \\n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \\n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \\n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\\n\\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\\n      4x4s can run the course.\\n     \\n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\\n\\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be\\n  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section\\n  of the course - we don\\'t want to have to separate someone\\'s bumper\\n  from their vehicle :) .\\n\\nThe Particulars:\\n\\n* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.\\n    (815)436-9382   (see map below)\\n* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.\\n* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine\\n* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.\\n* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)\\n* A valid drivers license is required\\n* Suggested equipment:\\n      CB Radio\\n      Compass\\n      Tow Strap and Clevis\\n      Clip Board and Pencil\\n* No alcohol during rally\\n* For more information contact\\n   Gary (815)727-3415\\n   Tom  (815)485-9346\\n   Norm Jr. (815)741-4853\\n   Brian (708)979-6083\\n\\n\\n                                            __\\n              Instant                      /\\\\\\n      |       Replay |             |         \\\\\\n      | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North\\n      |<----->|   | <------------> |\\n Rt30 |       |___|  |             |\\n------|---------------------------------------------\\n Exit |              |             |         ^\\n 257  |              |             |         |\\n      |              |             |         |\\n      |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |\\n      |              |Farm         |Ave      |\\n      |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.\\n      |              |             |         |\\n      |              |             |         |\\n      |                            |         |\\n      |                            |         |\\n      |       Rt80                 |         v\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n      |                            | Exit\\n      |                            | 130B\\n      |                            |\\n   \\n',\n",

Why you ask?  \\nSimple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit \\nCPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data \\nfrom memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when \\nit asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard \\nlinks 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in \\nthis simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means \\nthat a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you \\nhave a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide \\ndata, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks \\nare 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data \\nwith 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by \\none SIMM at a time.\\n\\nHope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your \\nquestion was not simple.

The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\\n    150MPH.)\\n\\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\\n    per-tire loads:\\n\\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\\n\\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\\n\\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\\n    all.\\n\\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\\n\\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\\n\\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\\n\\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\\n    normal tires on the car?\\n\\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\\n\\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\\n    of my car?\\n\\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\\n\\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\\n    car should I put them on?\\n\\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\\n\\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\\n\\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\\n    in this Q&A posting?\\n\\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\\n\\nSafety Equipment:\\n\\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\\n\\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\\n\\nBrake Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\\n    always wants to do this.\\n\\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\\n    or badly grooved.\\n\\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\\n    this really a good idea?\\n\\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\\n\\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\\n\\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\\n\\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\\n\\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\\n\\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\\n\\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\\n\\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\\n    economics are questionable for street use.\\n\\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\\n    information at this time.\\n\\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\\n    more.  Is it worth it?\\n\\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\\n\\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\\n\\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\\n    eventuality.\\n\\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\\n\\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\\n    ABS system in your car.\\n\\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\\n    becomes very important.\\n\\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\\n\\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\\n    needed here -- rpw]\\n\\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\\n    not very near the threshold.\\n\\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\\n    take over.\\n\\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \\n\\nGas Questions:\\n\\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\\n\\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\\n    needs.\\n\\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\\n\\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\\n\\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\\n\\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\\n\\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\\n    cars.\\n\\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\\n    in your gas tank.\\n\\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\\n\\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\\n\\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\\n\\nLubrication Questions:\\n\\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\\n\\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\\t\\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\\n\\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\\n\\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\\n\\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\\n\\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\\n    your wallet at all times.\\n\\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\\n\\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\\n\\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\\n\\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\\n\\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\\n    as conventional oils.\\n\\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\\n\\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\\n    How often should I change my oil?\\n\\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\\n    of storage.\\n\\nMisc. Questions:\\n\\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\\n    break.  What's the story?\\n\\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\\n\\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\\n\\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\\n\\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\\n    oriented vehicles.\\n\\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\\n\\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\\n    is probably the cause.\\n-- \\nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\\n\",\n",

This is a second RFD, replacing\\nthe one originally posted in January \\'93 (and never taken to a vote).  The\\nproposed groups are described below:\\n\\nNAME: \\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup\\nSTATUS:  Unmoderated.\\nPURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about\\n\\t system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.\\n\\nNAME:\\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc\\nSTATUS:\\t Unmoderated.\\nPURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,\\n\\t including issues such as security, networking features, console\\n\\t mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.\\n\\nRATIONALE:\\n\\tMicrosoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family\\n\\tof operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish\\n\\tto argue about the meaning of an \"OS\").  The family ranges from\\n\\tModular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to\\n\\tWindows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over\\n\\t50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the\\n\\tactual release is slated for May/June \\'93.\\n\\n\\tWhile Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares\\n\\tan application programming interface with the other members of the\\n\\tWindows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-\\n\\tdows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking\\n\\tand security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for\\n\\tWindows 3.1.\\n\\n\\tThe user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows\\n\\t3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses\\n\\tProgram Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-\\n\\tsents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced\\n\\tWindows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and\\n\\tNT also runs existing 3.1 applications.\\n\\n\\tThus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following\\n\\tgroups with the other members of the Windows family:\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.apps\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32\\n\\t\\n\\tThe following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as\\n\\twell as Windows 3.1:\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.announce\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.advocacy\\n\\t\\n\\tIn conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the\\n\\tWindows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal\\n\\tstructures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating\\n\\tsystems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have\\n\\tundergone major rewrites without having been split into separate\\n\\tnewsgroup hierarchies.\\n\\n\\tFurther, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --\\n\\twhen the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-\\n\\tgeneration Windows, \"Chicago\", debuts next year, surely it should\\n\\tremain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-\\n\\ttification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?\\n\\n\\nDISCUSSION PERIOD:\\n\\tThe discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  \\n\\nVOTING:\\n\\tThe CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on\\n\\tthe feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will\\n\\tbe accepted prior to the CFV.\\n-- \\n[ /tom haapanen -- tomh@metrics.com -- software metrics inc -- waterloo, ont ]\\n[       \"stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth.  now pull ]\\n[          up.  that\\'s how the corrado makes you feel.\"  -- car, january \\'93 ]\\n',\n",

I\\'ve now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to\\n>have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive\\n>all on the same card.  \\n\\nThat is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that\\nthere is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC.\\n\\n>Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.\\n\\nBut what about \"mysterious\" (and expensive) drivers to figure out?  At least\\nIDE doesn\\'t require drivers that consume precious conventional (DOS) memory.\\n',\n",

There is no much of\\nopinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.\\n(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although\\njust as reliable - BYTE Magazine\\'s conclusion ;-) ), so it\\'s hard to make\\nany decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. \\nHowever, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.\\n\\nBuddy Christyono\\nbuddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nsummary of replies\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nHello Buddy,\\n\\nI do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have\\nDD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.\\n\\nHere is my suggestion...\\n\\n1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with\\n\\tDOS 6.0\\'s compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that\\n\\tfor $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other\\n\\tutilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you \\n\\tare now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)\\n\\n2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95\\n\\tfor the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I\\n\\tdecided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!\\n\\tI have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with\\n\\tlarge SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It\\n\\tworks great.  Not delays.  I think the \"A\" is better than \"B\" \\n\\targuements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.\\n\\tI am looking forward to being able to \"LOADHIGH\" the DD sw.  That\\n\\thas been an annoyance.\\n\\n3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the\\n\\teffort to upgrade.\\n\\nJust my $.02 ...\\n\\nRegards,\\nMark Bagdy\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\nBuddy,\\n\\nI got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The\\ndocumentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic\\ninstallation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.\\n\\nThere were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max\\n& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a\\n203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had\\n~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows\\nswap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and\\nsuch).\\n\\nI have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it\\ntakes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very\\nhappy camper.\\n\\n-Bruce\\n-- \\n  Bruce F.

It was very easy to install.\\nThe only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game\\nwas trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed\\nregion of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. \\nThere was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.\\n\\tCompression performance for the whole disk has held steady \\naround 1.8:1.

For another example, read on:\\n\\nIn the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort\\nby Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple\\'s attention a problem with\\ncertain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice \"stick\" in\\nthe down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the\\nmachine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the\\nreported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of\\nBCGA65431. You\\'ll recognize this \"sticky button\" symptom immediately if you\\nhave such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it\\'s not subtle.\\n\\nLiam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead \\nsuggested that people contact Apple\\'s Customer Assistance Center directly\\n(_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described\\nmy defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told\\nApple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of\\nwarranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering\\nwhere my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the\\nserial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed)\\nrange Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.\\n\\nNothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make\\nit worth Apple\\'s while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.\\nPlease, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don\\'t assume you\\nknow what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start\\nhacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it.\\nPlease take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:\\n\\n                  United States      1-800-776-2333\\n                  Canada             800-665-2775\\n                  UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01\\n                  Australia          61-2-452-8000\\n                  Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500\\n\\nIf the number isn\\'t toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask\\nfor a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register\\nthe details of your case, including your mouse\\'s serial number.  Be firm.\\n\\nNetwork managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user\\nbases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don\\'t send mail to\\nme or post yet another \"sticky-button\" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  If\\nenough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Apple\\nwill eventually be forced to respond.

Personally, I have no use for changing the\\nregistration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to\\nbe solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour\\nreinstall that\\'s just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one\\nway or another.\\n\\nSo, while I\\'m not going to put much time into it myself, here\\'s the\\nprocedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:\\n\\n1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want\\nto install it.  I\\'ve been using c:\\\\WINSTALL myself.\\n\\n2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\\\\WINORIG.\\n\\n3.  Install from c:\\\\winstall.\\n\\n4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.  \\n    i.e., comp *.* \\\\winorig\\\\*.* >\\\\report.txt\\n\\n5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming\\nthey didn\\'t cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one\\nfile should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate\\nsaid offset in the original directory and see what\\'s there using a hex\\neditor, and do the same for the modified one.\\n\\n6.  You\\'re on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don\\'t\\nreally do cryptography.  It\\'s probably just an xor key or something; I\\nthink MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing\\nhis copy than with \"real pirates\" who will probably just disassemble\\nthe damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about\\nany obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original\\nfloppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able\\nto back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a\\ncompare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).\\n\\nAs I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and\\ndon\\'t do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one\\ndirectory to another may be less arduous.

We use it to\\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\\nvideo to the Net.\\n\\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\\n\\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces \"near VHS\" quality at 30 fields per\\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\\nfind distracting.\\n\\nIf you can get past this problem, you\\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing \\nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\\n\\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.

Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality\\nat any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs\\nrelated to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason\\nfor your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the\\nmarket today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font\\nvendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being\\nhand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted\\nTT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.\\n\\nTrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting\\nof diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the\\nWindows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can\\nbe done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not\\njust converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.\\n\\n> You can use both TT and ATM fonts at the same time, if you like.\\n> ATM (Type 1) fonts tend to be of higher quality\\n> and be more complete in terms of foreign characters.\\n\\nAgain, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone\\nconverts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT\\nallows for much more flexibility in this area as well.

The \"established\" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al.\\nThe  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team\\ncould successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did\\nwas formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop-\\nolistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth-\\ner  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly\\ndebatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de-\\nbate  is  academic.

Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd.

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\\n\\n  Support\\n\\n  Listserv mailing lists:\\n\\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\\n  Champaign, IL).

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.

Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

It just isn\\'t safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs\\noutnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in\\njunkyards.\\n\\nI find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the\\nMustang for poor brakes in relation to power.

It hasn\\'t passed as\\nfar as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than\\nthe US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred\\nto the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things\\nyou really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more\\nprofessional attitude to driving.

The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\\nFriz\\'s famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\\n\\n\\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/\\n\\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\\n\\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\\n\\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\\nengineering fixes was that until the engine\\'s oil pressure came up to\\nnormal, the engine\\'s valve timing would be more or less random,\\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\\n\\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\\n\\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\\nalmost perfect point:\\n\\n                    /\\\\\\n                   /()\\\\   <-lobe\\n                  / XX \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\\n valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)\\n                |  |   | |\\n                |  |===| |\\n                    =0=  <---piston\\n                     |\\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn\\'t show the\\n                             curvature because there was none in the\\n                             head itself.

I kid you not.\\n\\nThis is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing\\nlayers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.\\nMost helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner\\ncompacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or\\ndelaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years\\nfollowing his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose\\nup to 80% of it\\'s effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have\\na video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.\\n\\nPuncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and\\nother relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the\\ncomfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously\\ndegrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of\\n\"parking your lid\" on the mirrors, I suggest you look under the\\ncomfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly\\ndamaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.\\n--\\nJerry Lotto <lotto@lhasa.harvard.edu>         MSFCI, HOGSSC, BCSO, AMA, DoD #18\\nChemistry Dept., Harvard Univ.  \"It\\'s my Harley, and I\\'ll ride if I want to...\"\\n',\n",

Sci., Urbana, IL\\nLines: 117\\n\\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\\n\\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\\nStillwell would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Kurt\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt\\'s 57.6% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Double\\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.  So don\\'t\\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\\narticle.\\n\\nThe short version -- definition of terms\\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player\\'s total contribution.\\n\\nNational League\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nAlicea, L.      50    21    2    -1    .160    .865\\nSandberg, R.   108    42    1     1    .134   1.015\\nThompson, R.    65    20    5    -1    .104    .852\\nLind, J.        66     8   -2     1    .027    .571\\nDoran, B.       31    -1    4     0    .014    .705\\nDeShields, D.   51     1   -2     1   -.002    .755\\nHarris, L.      25    -4    0     1   -.019    .602\\nLemke, M.       43    -1   -5    -5   -.038    .573\\nMorandini, M.   37    -9   -6     0   -.069    .580\\nRandolph, W.    13   -16    3    -1   -.088    .582\\nBiggio, C.      34   -26   -4     0   -.091    .656\\nStillwell, K.    0   -43   -3    -1   -.236    .336\\n\\nOrdered by DOPS\\n\\n1.015 Sandberg\\n .865 Alicea\\n .852 Thompson\\n .755 DeShields\\n .705 Doran\\n .678 *NL Average*\\n .656 Biggio\\n .602 Harris\\n .582 Randolph\\n .580 Morandini\\n .573 Lemke\\n .571 Lind\\n .336 Stillwell\\n\\nAmerican League\\n---------------\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nFletcher, S.    59    18    5     1    .116    .811\\nReed, J.        83    17    3     1    .071    .708\\nRipken, B.      56     9   -1    -1    .044    .631\\nBaerga, C.      67     0   10     0    .029    .838\\nBlankenship, L. 34     2    2     1    .023    .757\\nMiller, K.      34    -4    1    -1   -.016    .725\\nAlomar, R.      62     4   -9    -2   -.020    .812\\nKnoblauch, C.   50   -13    7    -3   -.024    .718\\nBordick, M.     37    -4   -2    -1   -.025    .704\\nKelly, P.       42    -1   -5    -1   -.039    .636\\nWhitaker, L.    40    -8   -1    -2   -.041    .806\\nReynolds, H.    47    -6   -5     1   -.043    .603\\nSax, S.         56    -6   -9    -1   -.052    .555\\nSojo, L.        28   -11   -3     0   -.075    .602\\n\\nOrder by DOPS\\n\\n.838 Baerga\\n.812 Alomar\\n.811 Fletcher\\n.806 Whitaker\\n.757 Blankenship\\n.725 Miller\\n.718 Knoblauch\\n.708 Reed\\n.704 Bordick\\n.691 *AL Average*\\n.636 Kelly\\n.631 Ripken\\n.603 Reynolds\\n.602 Sojo\\n.555 Sax\\n\\nMore discussion --\\n\\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

Some\\n>send data to both, some only send data to the left channel\\n>(the first is preferrable, of course)\\n\\nOkay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.\\n\\nThe original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to\\nmake sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values\\ninto all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was\\nbecause\\nof how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by\\nscanning\\nthis block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on\\nsome machines).\\n\\nWhen the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to\\ngenerate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had\\nonce\\ndocumented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \"I\\nwant to\\nplay a mono sound\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted\\nthe\\ndocumentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers\\nof\\nsound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you\\nwant\\nto make stereo sound.\\n\\nEnter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are\\ninconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from\\nthe\\nIBM don\\'t want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game\\nwriters to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.\\n\\nSince the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output\\nhardware,\\nand the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase\\nworks.\\nOn some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase\\ngets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra\\n700/900/950\\nat least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel\\nonly.\\nBoth are technically correct interpretations of the original\\nspecification,\\nbut one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.\\n\\nIf developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono\\nsounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the\\nunderlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left\\nchannel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their\\ngames will only come out the left on some games.\\n\\nThe other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound\\non the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn\\'t really related.\\nIt is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of\\nthe different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which\\nare actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what\\nmachine\\nyou have.\\n\\nNow, to more directly address the question, the games you list:\\n>Lemmings\\n>Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)\\n>Glider 4.0\\n>OIDS\\nand also\\nHellcats,\\nSuper Tetris\\nOxyd\\n(and many more, these are just what I\\'ve tested)\\n\\nCheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.\\n\\n\\nOther games you list:\\n>Armor Alley\\n>Spectre\\n>Spaceward Ho!\\nand also\\nPGA Tour Golf\\nCivilization\\n(and more, these are again only from personal experience)\\n\\nUse the sound manager and work fine on all machines.\\n\\nThe more of the story is to developers: DON\\'T CHEAT!\\nReally, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to\\ndo,\\nbut I\\'m going say it anyway.\\nStop cheating on sound!\\nReally soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers\\nwill be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period\\nis about to end.\\nThe Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will\\nwork\\neven better soon, so use it.\\n\\nIn conclusion:\\nTo Doug, it isn\\'t a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.\\nTo Jon, it isn\\'t a choice to developers as to whether they want to send\\nsound\\nto both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of\\nautomatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all\\nhardware.\\n\\n\\nHave fun.\\n\\nDisclaimer number 1:\\nI don\\'t work on sound here at Apple, I\\'m just pretty well informed.\\nSo don\\'t write me with sound questions.\\n\\nDisclaimer number 2:\\nIf it says up above that I wrote anything like \"the grace period is about\\nto end\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not\\nallowed to say anything like that.

Everyone,\\n\\nBecause no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess\\nmy question was not so clear. Now I\\'d like to describe it in detail:\\n\\nThe offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which\\nrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse\\nand its offset is same everywhere.\\n\\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\\npositions of the ball\\'s center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\\ninternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!\\nHow many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most\\nimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?\\n\\nI was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year\\nto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this\\nproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)\\nis not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire\\nor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from\\na quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not\\nanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn\\'t touch the base and make things\\ncomplicated. Please give me a hint.\\n\\nI know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.\\nHowever, so many people involved in the problem \"sphere from 4 poits\".\\nWhy not an ellipse? And why not its offset?\\n\\nPlease post here and let the others share our interests \\n(I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the\\nsummary of the answers).\\n\\nYeh\\nUSC\\n',\n",

Can\\'t believe people actually put\\n>win as first in a tie breaker......\\n\\nGolly, I love stupid people. :-)\\nListen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,\\nthere exist these things called \"ties\".  A tie occurs when a game ends\\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \\nThere also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a\\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\\nat a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a\\nwin.  So, let\\'s say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That\\'s amazing.  So,\\nRex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then\\nthat\\'s what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the\\ntiebreaker and therefore have the \"better\" record, even though both teams\\nhad the same number of points.

I believe all of the\\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \\n\\nIMHO \\nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\\nthink it deserves some consideration.\\n\\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\\n\\nDarrell Evans - No.\\n\\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\\n\\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\\n\\n|> \\n|>      Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody\\n|> giving\\n|> \\n|> Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,\\n|> marginal.\\n|> \\n|> Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both\\n|> \\n|> shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.\\n|> \\n\\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\\n\\n|>      Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors\\n|> so\\n|> \\n|> liberally.

The only reason I do not say definately is he still\\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\\nprobably will turn into a definately.\\n\\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\\nthe possible votes.\\n\\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least\\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\\n\\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan\\nMaybe - Murray and L.

Currently I have  \\n8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.  \\nboth banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking  \\nof running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  \\nthat more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  \\ncan see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  \\n$400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  \\nthe entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  \\nthe machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  \\navoid...\\n\\nSo my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  \\nwell with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  \\n$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  \\ndo they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  \\nextra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  \\nISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  \\nprobably all of this is just wishful thinking...

We are currently at a little\\n over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from\\n New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada\\n Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.\\n\\n The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need \\n to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of \\n performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise \\n ratio found in rec.motorcycles.

Normally, the older boards have\\na 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char\\nthey received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the\\nright software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars. \\n\\n> 2) What does it do for high-speed modems?\\n> 3) Is it necessary for 14.4k or higher throughput?\\n\\nIf you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a\\ntime and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. But if you are\\nrunning a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the\\ncpu cannot work the whole time with one task. \\n\\nThe result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.\\n\\n> 4) Is it only for internal modems?\\n\\nNO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board,\\nwhereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port\\nwhich has the UART on board.\\n\\n> If you have any experience with 9600 or higher speed modems, please\\n> let me know what you think.

Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program\\n        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another\\n        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after\\n        pressing SPACE, you will enter \\'write2\\' menu.

I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.\\n\\nI just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I\\nhaven't seen IDE drives cheaper.\\n\\n: The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card\\n: (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down\\n: in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc\\n: or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions\\n: of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to\\n: come down in price.\\n\\nNo, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because\\nnobody did a common interface for the PC.

But, you bought your PC for\\nexpandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The\\nfollowing are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:\\n\\nA (partial?) list:\\n\\t1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them \\n\\tconcurrently.\\n\\t2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac\\n\\tand a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice\\n\\twith SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)\\n\\t3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For\\n\\tinstance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor\\n\\t212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will\\n\\twork no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the\\n\\ttermination, plug it in, and away it goes.\\n\\t4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that\\n\\tthe time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is\\n\\tquite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:\\n\\tto d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very\\n\\tnoticable, as many things can be going on at once.\\n\\nOne neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the\\nability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with\\nlittle problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've\\nadded to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to\\nhave 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive\\nall on the same card.  \\n\\nSimply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.

If you have only one printerport \\n( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4,\\nyou can assign IRQ2, if its free.

It would have the plus of RocketShare and\\nthe minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator,\\nNuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.\\n\\nApple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except\\nperhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC\\nslot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC\\naccelerators.\\n\\nOne potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will\\nneed a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with\\nRocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.\\n\\nApple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs\\nwill have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC\\nand that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in\\nexisting 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we\\'ll see groundbreaking\\nprices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we\\'ve seen\\nmuch cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.\\n\\nFirst generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed\\nCPUs so that they\\'ll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later.\\nThis should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled\\nfor clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which\\nI doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do\\nthis, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as\\nstandard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where\\nApple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup\\nis in order.\\n\\nBy the way, last week\\'s PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC,\\nPentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor\\nfront for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies.\\nAlso, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all\\nthe other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent\\nright now.\\n\\nOnce anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel\\'s market\\nposition will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially\\nif AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it\\nmight). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome\\nbattle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not\\nguaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of\\nseveral.\\n\\nMark\\n',\n",

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\\n6-3 opening victory.\\n\\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\\n\\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \\nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn\\'t played since March 29.\\n\\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey\\'s backup\\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\\nSaddledome popcorn.\\n\\n\"If I\\'m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I\\'d be\\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\\nplayoffs.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\\n\\nWhile insisting he is the Kings\\' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \\nVancouver on Thursday.\\n\\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn\\'t do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\\ngreat goalie is that he isn\\'t satisfied to be a backup.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you\\'re going to be No. 1, you\\'ve\\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You\\'ve got to be able to play when everything\\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\\nmore from him than he does.\"\\n\\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn\\'t play for a month after Knickle was signed\\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\\n\\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \\nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\\n\\n\"What I\\'ve been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn\\'t be here.\"\\n\\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn\\'t know me.  I\\'m not saying Barry \\ndoesn\\'t know me, but don\\'t say I\\'ve been without expectations.  If anything, I\\'m\\na perfectionist.\"\\n\\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \\neven though I didn\\'t play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It\\'s \\na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You\\'re almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \\nyou\\'re No. 1 and if you don\\'t you\\'re No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \\nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That\\'s what barry wanted me to explain \\nto him, why I didn\\'t come through when he counted on me.  I don\\'t know. What I \\ndo know is, it\\'s a sport.  I\\'ll be there.\"\\n\\nMelrose\\'s \"goalie of the future\" statement doesn\\'t mean much to Stauber. \"Before\\nyou know it, I\\'ll be 30 and there will be no future,\" he said.\\n\\n------\\n\\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \\nChannel 7 here in LA.

Since Hartford is pitiful, the\\nIslanders played pitiful.  Since Pittsburgh is great, the Isles will most\\nlikely play great.  This is most likely due to inexperience and very poor\\nshooting.

Then I decided to\\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\\nI also passed my road test.\\n\\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\\na car and been killed.\\n\\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\\nas I did.\\n\\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\\nyou're ready to use it.\\n\\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \\n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \\n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\\n\\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\\n\\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \\n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \\n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\\n>a difference)\\n\\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\\npoor.

I\\'m not sure if the cd\\'s are good, since\\nI\\'ve only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd\\'s shipped\\nto my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The\\nCD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive,\\nwhich supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to\\nattract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the\\nCD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly\\nlower price with two free CDs.\\n\\nThe Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I\\nthink, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the\\nthree mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple\\ncatalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo\\ncd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of\\nwhich are pretty good.\\n\\nThe NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and\\na data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around\\n$600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn\\'t multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible\\nbefore, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of\\nthe older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd\\'s\\nunless you buy it in a bundle.\\n\\nOf the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the\\nApple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it\\'s\\ncompatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it\\'s\\nspeed and performance. \\n\\nBTW, the models of the drives are:\\n\\nApple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)\\n\\nCD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I\\'m not sure, but it\\nis also something like with 3401)\\n\\nNEC:  CDR-74\\n\\n\\nI\\'m very happy with my drive.

       " 'From: farenebt@craft.camp.clarkson.edu (Droopy)\\nSubject: AHL Season in review (off ice stuff)\\nOrganization: Clarkson University\\nLines: 114\\nNntp-Posting-Host: craft.clarkson.edu\\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\\n\\nHere is a review of some of the off-ice things that have\\naffected the AHL this year.\\n\\n\\nST JOHN\\'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS\\nThe St John\\'s Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by\\nproblems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs\\' bus and\\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John\\'s Memorial Stadium.\\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\\nwill return to St John\\'s once the strike ends.\\n===================================================\\nSENATORS SOLD\\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \\nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \\nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \\n\\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\\n==================================================\\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \\n\\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\\n\\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\\nin the New Brunswick city.\\n\\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\\n1400 for this year.\\n============================================================\\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\\n=========================================================\\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps\\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\\n======================================================\\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\\nSports Network in Canada (but I\\'m not sure about that).

Now that the fan has Mike\\nLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the \\nbig name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance\\nHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he \\nhad Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  \\n  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:\\nMorning show:\\n  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, \\nand Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti\\nhad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries\\nto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of\\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\\nin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\\nit was a major story.\\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\\nstyles of host.\\n\\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \\nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\\nto transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \\nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning \\'guys\\')\\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \\neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\\nyou can\\'t get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\\n\\n2PM to 4PM:\\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \\nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\\nare often hilarious.  \\n\\n4 PM to 7 PM:\\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\\nMike Missanelli but I just can\\'t stomach Steve Fredericks.  \\nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\\nhomer now.  I don\\'t listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \\nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\\n\\n7 PM to Midnight:\\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my\\nnerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go\\nnuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)\\nOn FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets\\nJets, or St. John\\'s basketball.  If the game is on the\\nwest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course\\nI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but\\nWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.\\n(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the\\nIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))\\nDuring the summer, it\\nis all talk on WIP.\\n\\n\\nOverall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with\\nthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and\\n12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.   \\n\\n\\n\\n            Rich\\n-- \\n  \"You\\'ve read the hat, now see the movie.\"\\n                   -Imus in the morning \\n  \"A blurb?

The\\nexisting drive is currently a Western Digital as well, and is working fine,\\nbut I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave\\nrelationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.\\n\\nThe first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually\\ngoing to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0\\n\\nThe drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991\\nThey are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact\\nconfiguration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a\\nsetting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone).\\nThere are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are\\nfor setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine\\nhad none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the\\nback) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.\\n\\nWhen booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does\\nflicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.  \\nHopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not\\nbeing a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I\\nwould not even know how to do that.\\n\\nAny and all help on this is great fully appreciated.

Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I\\'ll give \\nyour question a shot. \\n\\nThe key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really \\nhave to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need \\n10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your \\npages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not \\ntoner.  But that should go without saying.\\n\\nMy PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little \\nwhile to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once \\nthe computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out \\nevery 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.  \\n\\nThe BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I\\'m assuming that the DeskJet can, or \\nHP wouldn\\'t sell many......\\n\\nSize is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built \\nlike a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.\\n\\nFinally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200\\'s resolution.  It looks like \\na good laser quality print.  The HP\\'s I\\'ve used.....they look like ink.  Not \\nas impressive.  \\n\\nSo, I chose the Canon.  Any other opinions?\\n',\n",

I believe I\\'m getting\\nsomething like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this\\nnumber compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and\\nthe state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?\\nObviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would\\nYOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?\\n\\nAlong those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD\\'s if I\\nwere to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?\\nAnd how much would it cost?\\n\\nI actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook\\nup a SCSI HD through it\\'s SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.\\nActually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and\\nown the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a\\nSCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?
